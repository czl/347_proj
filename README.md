This app is about connecting people with free events and items.  A graph datbase is used to make full use of the relationships in this complex problem.

This is a learning project integrating Neo4j, a graph DB, with oracle APEX's front-end.
We created a RESTful service to run on top of NEo4j's built-in 'RESTful' service.
We also started a small side project creating a front-end in javascript with bootstrap and jQuery.
